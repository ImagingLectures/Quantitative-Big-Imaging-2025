<h1>Exam questions QBI</h1>
<h2>Exam format</h2>
The QBI exam is oral, but you will be provided with pen and paper in case you need to draw figures to better explain your answers. The duration is 30 minutes. If you decided to make a project, we will use the project as a starting point for the exam and extend with questions that were not touched by the project. Below you find a collection of questions that may come during the exam.

During the exam you may be presented with an image get the task to outline how you would approach the analysis. Questions like the ones below will be accompanying your description to guide you or sometimes drill deeper into some specific part. 

There will <b>not</b> be any python questions during the exam.
