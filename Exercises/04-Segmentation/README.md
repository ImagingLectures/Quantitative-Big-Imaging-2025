# Exercises for lecture 4 - Basic segmentation

## Preparation
- Sync your QBI folder with Github (```git pull```)
- The images we use for this exercise are located in the ```./data``` folder.
- Start Jupyter

## Notebooks / Python
- [Python Fossil Segmentation Exercises](https://github.com/ImagingLectures/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2024/blob/main/Exercises/04-Segmentation/04-Fossil.ipynb)
    - [Partial solution, with the code provided](https://github.com/ImagingLectures/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2024/blob/main/Exercises/04-Segmentation/04-Fossil_guided.ipynb). The last part with the nerve is still up to you to solve.
