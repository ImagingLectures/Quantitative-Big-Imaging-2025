# Objectives
[Working with data frames and statistics](08-Statistics_DataFrames.ipynb): in this exercise we will combine statistical hyposthesis testing with the practical components of data frames and data visualization.
- You will learn how to use the `pandas` library to manipulate data frames and run statistical analysis on them.
- You will find out whether there is a statistical significant difference between two bone datasets.
- You will run a hypothesis test to determine if there is a significant difference between two groups.
- You will learn how to visualize the results of your analysis using `plotnine`.
